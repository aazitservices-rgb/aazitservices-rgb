# 👋 Hi, I’m Muhammad Z.

**Senior AI/ML Engineer | LLMs, AI Automation & Full-Stack (MERN)**

I specialize in building **production-grade AI systems**, with a strong focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **AI-driven automation**, and **full-stack web applications**. I don’t just prototype ideas—I engineer scalable, reliable solutions that solve real-world problems.

My work sits at the intersection of **machine learning**, **backend architecture**, and **modern frontend development**, turning complex AI capabilities into usable products.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Design, fine-tune, and deploy **LLM-powered applications**
- Build **AI automation pipelines** to replace manual workflows
- Architect **scalable backends and APIs** for ML systems
- Develop **end-to-end products** (model → backend → frontend)
- Optimize AI systems for **performance, cost, and reliability**
